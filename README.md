# Music-Player
This Project allows you to play songs in your own music player. 
It is done by using Tkinter(GUI for Python).
A rootpath folder contains songs which will be displayed on the music player.
If you want to run this code, create a folder and put your songs in that folder. Copy the folder path and change it in the roothpath and run the code.
